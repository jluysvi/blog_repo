## What is a Brand?

If you don’t have a solid grasp of what branding really is, you might struggle to find compelling reasons to put time and effort into it. In this first section I will do my best to explain what a brand really is so that we can then explore why it’s so powerful and then how you can go about strengthening your own brand. In the end of the article, we’ll take a hypothetical business and create a brand for it.


### What a Brand Is Not

A very common misconception is that a brand is just the logo, colour scheme and design rules your business uses for its promotional material. While those are important _elements_ of a strong brand, they can not stand in for a true brand identity. Those elements flow out of and reinforce the brand in the eyes of the public, but they are not the brand itself. I’ll expand on this a bit later. 


### The Structure of a Brand

Later in the article, I’ll cover the structure of a brand in much more detail, but it’ll be good to have a rudimentary idea of how a brand is constructed before we move on. A brand begins with the core values and imagery that the owner wishes the public to associate with their business. Next would be the voice or the character of the brand, which is the way it speaks to the public. Lastly there are the visuals like the logo, typography and colours, which help to reinforce the brand. All of these elements combine to form the _feeling_ that the customers have about the business and that feeling is what the brand is. 


### Imagery and Associations

As I said above, a brand is the feeling that a customer gets when they think about your brand. This feeling is reinforced by the imagery they see in their head and the associations they have with your brand. 


#### Coca Cola

CocaCola have poured billions into their marketing campaigns over the years and I want you to notice something about the advertisements that they make. Do they ever advertise the product itself? No, because when you boil it down, a Coke is just some brown fizzy water with way too much sugar in it. It _does_ taste good, but without the brand it is nothing extraordinary. That’s why every CocaCola ad is about the feeling surrounding their product and not the product itself. It’s images of summer, fun with friends, a sunny beach with colourful umbrellas and beach balls.

#### Marlboro

From the 50s to the 70s, Marlboro ran the most wildly successful ad campaigns you could ever imagine. Their subject was the Marlboro Man. Before the Marlboro campaign, cigarette companies focused on highlighting the taste and smoothness of their cigarettes. The problem is, how much can you really say about the taste of a cigarette? Not much at the end of the day. Marlboro took a different approach. Instead of selling the product, they sold the imagery and feelings they wished to project onto the product. The Marlboro Man was rugged, masculine, a “wild stallion”. He was on the ranch or working on his car or flying an aeroplane. He could do anything and looked as cool as can be while doing it. Marlboro’s sales skyrocketed and they went from a tiny little company on the verge of bankruptcy, just before WW2, to the best selling cigarette manufacturer in the world in 1972. The Campaign was so powerful that many of those images still stick with the brand, 50 years after cigarette companies have been banned from advertising.

#### Dos Equis

A modern Marlboro Man is The Most Interesting Man In The World, who is the fictional character and spokesperson for Dos Equis, the Mexican beer company. He travels around the world, fights tigers, meditates with Hindu monks, beats professional racing drivers etc. I don’t know how good Dos Equis beer is, but I know that 90% of people probably don’t buy it because of how it tastes. They buy it because of the fantastic brand that has been built around it.

## Why Brand is So Important

At this point, you should already be connecting some of the dots in your head and realising just how important brand is. In this section, I’ll explain the reasons in a bit more detail.


### No Longer Commoditized

When you have a strong brand, whatever you’re selling stops being commoditized. Commoditize from Merriam Webster is, _“to render (a good or service) widely available and interchangeable with one provided by another company”_. If you’re selling something and you don’t have a brand, the only thing you can do to be more competitive is to lower costs or increase quality or tweak some other variable related to your profits. You are totally at the mercy of the markets, because there is nothing that sets you apart. If you sell shoes, you have to sell them at slightly cheaper prices than every other shoe manufacturer or no-one will buy from you. If you have a strong brand, however, you stop having to compete in the “shoes” market and you start standing in a category of your own. We’ll get to examples in just a minute but I think you probably already have a few in mind.


### Increases Perceived Value

What a brand does then, is increase the perceived value of something. Perceived value is what someone _thinks_ something is worth, irrespective of the actual cost to produce it. When a product or service is commoditized, people will just look for the cheapest one that will get the job done. The stronger the brand is however, the less important the price becomes. 


### Real Example

It costs Nike around $28 to produce and ship a shoe to the US. They sell that same pair of shoes for $100, which is a 200% markup. These are just their run of the mill sneakers that you can find in every shoe shop. Some of their exclusive releases sell for thousands of dollars per pair. Without the brand, Nike is nothing. To illustrate this, think how Nike sources their manufacturers. Nike goes searching through the whole world for the manufacturer that can make shoes for them at the lowest cost possible, with decent quality. They settle for some sweat shop in Vietnam that uses child labour to keep their costs down. Manufacturers don’t have brands and therefore don’t have any leverage. They can only make their costs lower.  


## Elements of a Brand


### Values and Imagery

Everyone has a set of values and beliefs that they use to go through life, make decisions and interact with people. As a business owner, these values and beliefs will spill over into your business and dictate how people look at your business. The owner of a bank will likely have a different set of values and beliefs that he will want to project than the owner of a local pub. The bank owner might want people to associate values like trust, integrity and honesty with his bank. The pub owner, on the other hand, would rather project values like camaraderie and brotherhood, since it’s a place for friends to get together. 


### Feel and Imagery

When you do advertising for your business, take your values and beliefs and think how you might turn those values into images and emotions that people will associate with your business. If you own a bank, you might want your customers to feel safe and that you have everything under control. Images like marble floors, quality furniture in a big office, people wearing tasteful suits. These are just examples, and they might even be bad examples since some people might even have negative emotions associated with those images, but the point is to really get to know your market deeply and think how you could communicate your values with them. 


### Character and Stories

A great way to build your brand and humanise your business is to create a character or a voice that you use to speak with the public. This is very much an extension of the imagery and the two should be very closely related. In the example of the pub, you might want a friendly, boisterous character that breaks into song after having too many drinks. The reason businesses use mascots is because they can be very effective, just make sure your mascot has some real soul and personality otherwise it might do more harm than good.

If your business has some interesting history or you have a good story to tell, you should absolutely use it. Don’t just put it into the about page on your website, find a way to work it into your promotional material as well. 


### Logos and Colour

A logo can be a very useful tool for a business because it’s easy for someone to remember(if it’s well designed) and it gives them an image to associate with your brand. A logo should not be designed in isolation. Whether you are designing it yourself or outsourcing the task to a graphic designer, you should think very carefully about the feeling that you would like your logo to evoke. Some brands have gotten so big that they have simplified their logos to almost complete abstraction, but that’s because their brand recognition is so high that people don’t associate that image with anything else. Pick a few images and meanings you would like to incorporate into your logo and work from there.

Colour is also a great way to communicate what your brand is about, but is somewhat dependent on the region you are in, since different cultures associate different meanings with different colours. In some countries, like Japan, red is a colour of strength and peace, while other cultures might associate it with danger and violence. Think about the feelings you would like to evoke and then pick a colour palette from there. 


### Typography

Typography is a massive subject that I can’t even scratch the surface of in this article. I do have a few small pointers that you can keep in mind, though. In cases where you want to evoke trust and timelessness, it might be better to use a serif font. If your brand is based on a more modern approach or your focus is on innovation, a sans-serif font might be a better choice. 


## Building a Brand From Scratch

Let’s have some fun in the last part of the article and build a brand identity from scratch. We’ll use the pointers outlined in the article and use them to make our own brand. For this exercise I have chosen an investment fund to build a brand for. If you’ve watched Wolf of Wall Street, you might get a good chuckle from this one. 


### Characteristics

We're working with other people’s money here. Millions of dollars of it in fact. We want them to feel like they can trust us, like we’ve been in this game for many, many years and that the market is just subject to our whims. We want to project confidence and just a slight tinge of arrogance. We take this very seriously, but we're still calm and relaxed. 

This is the type of fun you can have when you are crafting your brand. 


### Name

We want to sound like professionals here, we didn’t just choose some wishy-washy made up name. We are Cunningham and Associates Inc.


### Image and Voice

The images and the voice we use in our advertisements are very important, but what’s just as important is how we conduct ourselves. If we show up to meet a client, it certainly doesn’t say “heritage” or “trustworthiness” if we show up in flip-flops and a wifebeater. A full suit isn’t necessary, but just looking neat and presentable can make a massive difference. This might not sound like anything “brand” related, but when you think about brand as the impression that your business leaves on the minds of the public then it's absolutely related.

In real-life and in our promotional material, we speak from a position of authority. We know this industry like the back of our hands. We have lived and breathed it and we know how to take their money and turn it into more money. 


### Visuals

When you are designing your brand, you might want to construct a mood board, or a collection of images that you feel captures the essence of what you would like your brand to be. Here’s the mood board I made for our fictional company.

No don't take this little exercise too seriously. You'll want to put a lot more thought into creaing your own brand than we did for this experiment. Take a day and think it throught properly, because much of your success might depend upon it.
