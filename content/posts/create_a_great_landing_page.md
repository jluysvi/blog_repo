This article is coninuation of the [sales funnel](https://cobusuys.com/posts/sales_funnels/) article, I wanted to explore landing pages in more depth and I will probably write articles about every other step of the sales funnel as well.

A landing page is the very first step of your sales funnel and it could very well make or break the success of your marketing campaign, that’s why it's so important to understand what makes a landing page successful. 

In this article we’ll explore how to create a landing page with very high conversion rates but I won’t be mentioning any specific tools because I believe that once you understand the underlying principles, you can use any tools you want to create a great landing page.


## Starting With Great Copy

Even if everything else on your landing page is pretty subpar, you could still make a killing if you have fantastic copy. Copy is the lifeblood of your landing page and it’s what you should be spending the vast majority of your time on, way before you start playing with all the other buttons and dials. In this first section we’ll delve deep into what makes effective copy and how you can write in a way that will make your dream customers trip over themselves to give you their money(or at least put in their email address). 


## The Headline

David Ogilvy is revered as one of the greatest minds in advertising. He was once quoted as saying this about the headline, _“On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.”_ Well we better make sure we have a fantastic headline then, but what makes a good headline? 


### Grabbing Attention

The main goal of any headline is to grab the reader by the throat. Make them **stop** scrolling or turning pages. Use powerful words in your headline that people respond to. One of the most effective things you can use in a headline is numbers. There are so many “top 10” and “7 ways” lists, because they are incredibly effective. If you are giving away a fitness brochure, **5 Steps to a Beach Body**, would be more effective than **How to get a Beach Body**. Don’t scoff at words like FREE either, it might seem a bit overdone, but that’s because it works. 


### Addressing Your Audience

Make sure to call out the people your ad is for in your headline. This is an incredibly powerful technique. You are making sure your target audience knows that this offer is just for them. Don’t make it too broad. If you do that, you’ll miss out on the people you really want to target and the rest will likely not respond anyway. Try **This is How Young Families are Finding Their Dream Homes**, instead of **How You Can Find Your Dream Home**. Replace “young families”, with whatever demographic you are in and just think how much more of an effect the headline would have on you.


### Deliver the Whole Message

Since the vast majority of people only read the headline, it pays to include everything they need to know in the headline itself. Don’t be vague about what you are offering and hope that people read the body copy to find out. You might get lucky once in a while, but most of the time it won’t work. Include the entire selling premise in the headline. **New Home Insurance Policy From AcmeCo. Slashes Costs in Half **instead of **Find Out About This Innovative New Home Insurance Policy**.


### Get Them To Read Further

Two other advertising greats, Joseph Sugarman and Eugene Schwartz, argued that the most important function of a headline is to get the reader to read the first line of the body copy and the function of that line is to get you to read the next one and so on. If you can get people to actually read your body copy, you have a much higher chance of selling them on your product, especially if you are selling something high-ticket.


## Body Copy


### Setting the Scene

Don’t start selling right away. You want to prime the potential client and set the scene to put them in a state where they are receptive to being sold something. What do I mean by this? Quite simply, you want to dig out all the problems that might have been scratching at them and lay them out in front of them, so you can then swoop in and position your product or service as the solution to their problems. If your product does not solve a direct problem, it must at least help them in one of three things: relationships, health or wealth. Paint a picture of how life would look if they had your product. In short, what’s in it for them?


### Each Line Leads to the Next

As I alluded to earlier, the sole purpose of a line of copy is to get the potential client to read the next line and then the next and so on. If you can get them to read half of the copy, they will likely be on the “slippery slope” as Joseph Sugarman calls it. At this point they just can’t stop reading and will go on until the very end. This should be your goal. If you can get the reader to read every word you have written, then the chances are very good that they will be sold on what you have to offer. You can use verbal teasers like, “but here’s the best part”, or “let me explain” which arouses just enough curiosity in your potential client to read on.


### The Guarantee

If you are asking serious money for a product, a guarantee can be a very powerful way to give people that final push that they need. The biggest problem when making a high ticket purchase, is risk, and a good guarantee can diminish that risk significantly. I think this goes without saying, but never make a guarantee that you won’t be able to back. 


## Design Principles


### A Great Example

Below is a great example of a landing page by the fine folks at ClickFunnels.

### Call to Action

Beside the copy, the call to action is probably the second most important thing. The call to action is what tells the potential clients what to do after they have read the copy, or if they are already interested, what to do right now. Your call to action is something like, **Sign Up for a FREE Trail Right Now**, or **Download This PDF and Learn to DOUBLE Your Profits in 90 Days**. You want it to be big, bold and unmissable. You never want people to leave because they don’t know what you want them to do.


### Colours and Hierarchy

Colours can be very powerful if they are used correctly. It’s important to know your audience and what countries they are from since certain colours can have different connotations in different cultures. Red, for example, can be viewed as dangerous by some and lucky by others. Red is also one of the best colours to draw someone's attention. You want to focus on highlighting one or two things on your page with bright or contrasting colours, don’t just slap on every colour in the rainbow to draw more attention.

Hierarchy is the order of importance that you assign the elements in your page. First in the hierarchy will likely be your headline and you can establish that hierarchy with a large, bold font that is different from the body copy. Secondary elements like the call to action, that are still very important, can then be highlighted with colours. Keep the path of vision in mind as you design your page, in other words, which items your eyes jump to first and where they go after that. 


### Images and Videos

It can be very beneficial, if not strictly necessary, to include a video or an image in your landing page that covers the same topic as the body copy. Some people just don’t like reading as much and might prefer a more visual presentation. Once again, think about your audience.


### One Way In, One Way Out

When you make a landing page, don’t have any links to the rest of your site on it. You don’t want people to get distracted and wander off into the other pages on your site and then never give you their email. You want them to be hyper focused on whatever you are putting in front of them with zero distractions. 


### Make it Easy

When they click your call to action button, make it as easy as possible to get the action done with. Don’t make them fill out a big form, just give them a single field to fill in their email or make a payment and then give them what they came for. You want to make the whole process as seamless and painless as you possibly can to increase the chances of success.


### Social Proof

If you have any, it can be very effective to include testimonials from previous clients that you did work for or who were helped by your product. Make sure that the testimonials are not generic, but describe exactly how your product fixed their problem. _“I was a bit sceptical, but choosing XYZService has been a game changer for me. They helped me to grow my business in ways that I didn’t think were possible. More than worth it”_, instead of, _“Great service!”_.


## Testing

Lastly, you should do rigorous testing after you have launched the page. You might think that you wrote better copy than Eugene Schwartz and that you have struck the perfect balance between bold and classy with your headline, but only real data will tell you if you have a winner. Installing trackers like a Meta Pixel and Google Analytics will give you valuable data that you need to improve your page for the next run. 


### Split Testing

The simplest and most effective way to test the effectiveness of an element is to do split testing. This is when you run two versions of a page simultaneously. Half of your ad traffic gets driven to one page and half to the other. It’s very important that you change only one or two variables between those pages at one time, so you can find out exactly what works and what doesn’t.
