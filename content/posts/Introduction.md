## Who am I?
Hi, my name is Cobus Uys, pleased to meet you. I'm a young entrepreneur from Bloemfontein, South Africa with a passion for learning and improving every aspect of my life. This blog is here to serve as a reference for everything that I have learned and to document my journey as I attempt to become successful. It might seem strange to share all the secrets that I uncover, but I was so frustrated with having to dig through mountains of bullshit to get to the good stuff and I want to spare some other people that pain.
## Why a blog?
### As a Reference for Myself
As I alluded to on the front page, this blog is mainly to serve as a reference for me and to help other people, but I will admit that it's not all altruistic. A while ago I realised that I still have a ton to learn if I truly want to provide value to my clients and if I wanted to stand out above the competition in my market.
### Monetization and Branding
I was thinking about this for a while when a lightbulb went on and I thought, "If I'm gonna spend a year learning, I might as well make some money from it." As this blog grows I hope to monetize it so I can get a small stream of income which I will use to develop my business.

This blog won't just be written in isolation. I will be making content on other platforms like TikTok and Youtube. I also want to start a podcast not too long from now. The reason for the elaborate scheme is that I want to build my personal brand and in the process I want to learn skills like marketing, advertising and networking. 
### Portfolio
The last reason is that I really love to write and I want to refine and practice my writing so this website can serve as a portfolio that I can use to get some work as a freelance writer. Every cent I get will basically go to developing my business. 
## Plans for the Blog
### Content
You may be wondering which topics will be covered in the blog. Below is a short and non-exhaustive list of the topics that I hope to write about. This list will likely be updated in the future.
#### Branding
Recently I have become fascinated with branding. It's obviously about more than just your logo and your colour scheme, in fact good brands are worth orders of magnitude more than the actual products that a company sells. Just take a look at a company like Nike, they are basically *just* selling their brand and asking hundreds of dollars per pair of shoes for it. Another example is the service industry, where building a good brand can mean asking 10x the price of everyone else, because people associate your name with quality, integrity or any other adjectives of your choosing. I want to find out what makes a good brand and how I can build my own brand in order to stand out above my competition.
#### Marketing
Gary Vee recently said sales is just bad marketing. If he says so then I'm going to look into it. All jokes aside, it makes a ton of sense. The most people you can ever reach in a sales call is one person. With proper marketing, you can get clients to come to you instead of having to do the outreach yourself. The ultimate goal is to reach your customers with your organic content and not having to spend a cent of money of advertising. I want to learn how to do effective organic outreach and use it to grow my own business.
#### Advertising
If we're being realistic, organic marketing alone will likely not bring you too many clients for a while. Therefore, I want to learn how to do effective advertising. How important are all the knobs and dials that you can tweak in a Facebook campaign? Is copy still the ultimate weapon? These are some of the things I want to find out. When I get some cashflow I will start doing some advertising and using the things that I've learned. I'll write some articles to report my findings. 
#### Real-Estate
Real-Estate has always been fascinating to me. It's probably the oldest way to make money that is still around today. How do you actually make money from real-estate? How can you know if you have made a good investment? What should you do if something like a housing market collapse happens? I'd like to interview real-estate professionals to get some insight into their view of things, which I think will make for very interesting articles or podcasts. 
#### Writing
As I said earlier, writing is a great passion of mine, but unfortunately I haven't had time to do any writing these last few years. I think this blog is going to be a great creative outlet for me. I will be writing a few articles of the craft of writing, but much more pointedly, copywriting, which is an essential skill that every business owner needs to learn. 
#### Networking
I really don't know much about networking but I know it's very important to learn. I'm not sure if I'll find much to write about, but I guess we will just have to wait and see. 
### Style
Because I will be writing about a large amount of topics, the style and tone of many of the articles will likely vary. I will categorise the articles as well as I can, the two main tags will likely be opinion and research but there might be others that I have not thought of right now. I don't want the blog to be too formal and I will aim to make the research articles fun, if not easy, to read. I also plan to write articles that are summaries of content that I read or watched and will link the original sources in them. 
Although I am someone that swore off emojis for a long time, I have come to see them as a very useful tool for communication and I think they are a great way to set a more informal tone. 

I think the length of the articles will differ a lot depending on the topic and style of the article. I will always try to be as brief as possible without skimping on any of the details. 
### Growing my Audience
The main way I plan to grow my audience is simply high quality content. I want to provide as much value I can to my readers and not too long from now, my clients. Another way I plan to grow is by crossposting and linking my content between my different social media channels. I won't be posting much content on LinkedIn, but I will link everything I create on my other platforms on there.

I plan to cover similar topics on my TikTok that I cover on the blog so I can drive traffic to the blog from there. Lastly, I plan to start a podcast. I want to interview some experts in the fields that I am covering at that time and use that to make content on my other platforms. I'm not sure if this is actually a good strategy but I'll find out soon enough if it's working or not.
## Closing Thoughts
One last reason for the blog is to keep myself accountable. I think it's going to give me something concrete to work towards every day, besides being a great reference. I'm going to look into adding comments to the site once it starts to get enough traffic, but until then you can just send me a message on social media. I'm really excited for this next chapter.

Goodbye, see you in the next post.ðŸ‘‹
