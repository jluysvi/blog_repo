I’ve been meaning to redo all the copy on my business website for a while now. I have learned a ton since I’ve put it up and honestly, looking at it now makes me feel a bit disappointed at just how terrible it is. Firstly, the headlines are horribly generic. If anyone came to my site and they weren’t already sure about using my services, I would probably lose them. The body copy is nothing to write home about either, it’s all about me and not about them. That’s terrible if you want to sell something. The only redeeming feature is that the site looks pretty nice, but that doesn’t mean anything if it doesn’t make people want to use my services. 

I’m going on a mission to fix up my site before I start running my next Facebook Ad Campaign and in this article I’m going to explain every step I’ll take to make it better and explain why every step is so important. I’m going to be using principles that I’ve learned from some of the best copywriters in the world and I’ll link some of the books that helped me at the end of the article.


## 1. Fixing the Headlines

Most people are only going to read the headline and then promptly leave if it does not grab their attention immediately. Making a good headline isn’t that hard, it just takes some time. The best approach is to make a list of at least ten headlines and then choose the best one from there.


### Be Specific

The worst thing you can do(and that I’ve done in the past, unfortunately) is to not be specific enough with your headlines. Don’t just write a generic headline, because that’s how you think headlines should look. Make sure the headline is laser focused on the clients that you want to be serving. If you haven’t figured that out yet, it would be a very good step to take first. It really grabs people’s attention when it feels like you are addressing them directly in the headline. 


### Value Proposition

State your value proposition as early as possible. If you can do it in the headline without sounding silly, then do it. You want people to know why they should stay to read the rest of the site immediately, otherwise they _will _leave.


### Make Them Read On

Many of the greatest copywriters in the world argued that the only reason for the headline is to get the reader to go onto the next line and then the next and the next and so on. Make sure your headline creates a bit of intrigue or makes the reader ask a question that would want the answer to. 

### Example

I always like using Clickfunnels as an example. You just can't go wrong if you study these guys carefully.

### Style and Typography

You want the headline to be very clearly visible and it should be the first thing that your eye jumps to on the page. With that being said, there is no need to be garish. Bright or flashing colours certainly draw attention, but it’s probably not the attention that you want. Ask yourself at every step if _you_ would buy from someone if their website looked like this. 


## 2. Call to Action


### Make it Visible

The worst thing that can happen on your website is if your copy sells really well but the reader has no idea what to do next. The call to action is the only thing that can be slightly “in your face” because it’s really important that it’s not missed. It should be in multiple places on the page, not just at the top. 


### Colour

The colour of the CTA should be similar to the rest of the colour theme on the website, but it should be clearly differentiated from everything else on the page. If your site is full of blue hues, make it extra dark or extra light so it can stand out. 


### Make the Action Clear

Make it very clear what the reader is signing up for, exactly. If you want them to buy something directly, state the price and maybe even the guarantee so they know what they are in for. If the button signs them up for a newsletter, make sure they know if it’s monthly or weekly. You get the idea.

### Example

Shopify managed to squeeze in their call to action no less than three times without looking too overbearing.

## 3. Visuals

I believe the best way to find a good design for your site is to take inspiration from other websites in your industry. Visitors don’t want to be confused because your site is too different from the norm. There are many standard web design practices these days, like a header with navigation links, a footer with contact information etc. When it comes to the site structure it’s better to be bog standard and let your copy do the talking rather than flashy visuals. 


### Structure and Hierarchy

Make sure the content in the site is clearly partitioned and organised. Large blocks of text can look very intimidating to read and may dissuade some people that might have otherwise read the content. Make sure that there is also a clear hierarchy in your design. This means that there is an order of importance in your elements, which gives the reader an idea where to start and where to go from there. If everything is flashing in their face, they have not idea where to start reading. 


### Dark Mode

While dark mode is all the rage these days(I even have it as an option on this site), it might not always be the best idea. Studies have shown that black text on a white background is a lot more readable than the other way around and it even increases comprehension. 


## 4. Body Copy


### Know Who You’re Talking To

You should know who you’re selling to. Any copy is a lot more effective if you know how your customer speaks, their needs and their pain points. If you’re selling high tech gadgets, your market is probably men that have enough disposable income to buy them. Put yourself in their shoes before writing.


### Setting the Mood

Before you start throwing your prices at the reader, you should try to get them in a buying mood. This just means that you are basically setting the scene for them. Showing them the benefits that the product or service will have for them(instead of listing the features right away) and showing them what life could be like with your product. There is no need to embellish  too much here. Don’t act like your bar of soap is going to change their entire life. It’s a soap and it smells nice. It can be great for a romantic gift, a bit of me time etc. You want the reader to feel like they’ve held it in their hands or make them feel how much easier it could make a certain task for them.


### Point of No Return

If you can get them to read more than half of your copy, which is not an easy task, then they’ll probably read everything, add mini hooks into your writing to keep them interested and reading further. Examples are “but here’s where it gets interesting”, “the next part might surprise you”. Just don’t overdo it, otherwise it might look like a Buzzfeed article. 


### Guarantee

A good guarantee can be one of the most effective ways to get readers over the tipping point and get them to buy the thing you’re selling, especially if it’s a high ticket product or service. A guarantee lowers the risk that a potential customer takes on when buying your product and shows that you really stand behind it. As long as what you’re delivering is good, a guarantee poses little risk to you.


## 5. Credibility


### Speak with Authority

Make sure your expertise on the products shines through. It’s okay to use some technical language to show that you know what you’re talking about, but use it sparingly and in small dashes. 


### Social Proof

If you have any testimonials, make sure to include them. Include a picture of the person so there is a real face connected to the quote. Video is even better, but if it sounds too scripted you might lose trust. Show where your work has been featured if you have ever done work for larger brands or corporations.

### Be Honest

Honesty is the best policy. If you are selling something, be transparent about the shortcomings, but also highlight why they are not that significant. Don’t try to lie about any of the features or your experience because it will shine through.
