## Preamble

If you‚Äôve ever been frustrated because your products and services are not selling as well as you would hope, you should seriously consider setting up a sales funnel. If you‚Äôve ever looked into more advanced marketing tactics, you‚Äôve probably heard of the term before, but if you‚Äôre anything like me it was probably hard to wrap your head around. In this article I will do my best to explain exactly what a sales funnel is, why it‚Äôs so effective and how you can go about implementing one of your own, even if you don‚Äôt pay for some of the premium tools like Clickfunnels(though I must add that they are more than worth it).


## What is a sales funnel?

The idea of a sales funnel is to gradually ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù your potential customers over a period of time by offering them value over a longer time span instead of trying to jump directly into your sales pitch. The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù sales funnel was thought up way back in 1898 by E St Elmo Lewis and the core principles are just as relevant and effective today, though there _have_ been some modern iterations of sales funnels by pioneers like Richard Branson, which we‚Äôll discuss a bit later. 

The classic sales funnel consists of four distinct steps: Awareness, Interest, Desire and Action, or AIDA for short. Let‚Äôs explore each step a little further.



### 1. Awareness

The first step, which most business owners are actually pretty familiar with, is the awareness stage. This is where you go hunting after your target audience with advertisements in the places where they consume their media like magazines, TV and social media. The problem is that many business owners make the mistake of already trying to pitch their product or service, before properly establishing their brand. Essentially the awareness stage is there to make your brand stick in people's heads for a while. You can position yourself as a leader in whatever niche you are in by releasing value packed and informative content on your social media pages and even your advertisements, though you would likely want to use what is called a ‚Äúlead magnet‚Äù when advertising, so you can start getting the contact info of the people that show some interest.


A lead magnet is simply a page where people exchange their contact info for some highly desirable information you have. The key is to make sure that people would actually want the information and you need to make sure that you actually put in some effort into whatever you are giving away so people don‚Äôt feel like they were just duped into giving their email, because that is a surefire way to end up in the spam box.

### 2. Interest

Now that you have given your potential customers a ton of value for free, they might become interested in what else you could offer them. This next step in the funnel is all about slowly building interest in your products or services by drip feeding the suspects some useful content. In this step you can start to set the stage and introduce your company and what you‚Äôre all about. According to studies, most clients need to hear your value proposition at least three to five times before they will even consider buying your product. This is another reason why having a sales funnel is so essential. It allows you to slowly nurture a relationship with a client instead of throwing your product in their face and yelling buy now while quickly listing all the features. 

### 3. Desire

Some of the suspects now turn into prospects as their desire for your product or service slowly starts to build. The key in every step of this process is to scratch open their itches and wounds, by showing that you know exactly what they are struggling with and positioning your products or services as the soothing balm for their itch. The benefit of using a funnel is that you don‚Äôt just have people buying your products or services because they look interesting, they buy them because they truly _want _them. You have shown them that you are the person who can solve their problem by giving them the exact solutions to problems they were already facing.

### 4. Action

The last step in the funnel is when all the hard work finally pays off. You have slowly nurtured your funnel and now a certain percentage of them will start to become paying customers. The great thing is that you have the potential to still convert some of the people that did not respond as quickly, unlike with traditional marketing tactics _and _you have a much greater potential to have a long term relationship with customers that you nurtured over a long time.

## Why Use a Sales Funnel

The short answer is that it‚Äôs a much more efficient way to get and retain clients in the long run. For the longer answer, let‚Äôs do a comparison between the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way to acquire new customers and how it compares to a sales funnel. 


### The ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù Why of Doing Things

With the traditional advertising approach you basically have one chance to win over you customer. I‚Äôm exaggerating a bit here because they will likely see your ad more than once but every time they see the ad, all they see is that you‚Äôre trying to sell them something and they will likely decide whether they are interested or not within a split second and after that their brain will just blank out your ad as they scroll past. 

At this point you haven‚Äôt even gotten the chance to tell them how great your product is or what it can do for them and because the marketing tactic is flawed(you tried to pitch too soon), you might lose your customer then and there. 


### The Sales Funnel Method

What if, instead of trying to pitch immediately, you actually **show** your clients that your offer will solve every problem they have instead of **telling** them that it will. How do you even do this? Give them something incredibly valuable, for free. I know this might sound a bit scary, I mean, what if the info you give them is all they need and they never come back? First of all, that is highly unlikely. What will probably happen, is that they will read your free PDF or watch your webinar and see that you know what you‚Äôre talking about. If they implement some of your strategies and they actually work, then that‚Äôs even better. Now you‚Äôve given them value and you‚Äôve shown them that you know your story. Think about this from your own perspective. If a stranger came up to you and wanted to sell you a $100 course, you would likely just shoo him away.On the other hand. If someone solved a problem that has been bugging you for a long time and did it for free, offered to sell you a course that would solve more of your problems, would you not be much more likely to buy it?


## How to Implement a Sales Funnel

Just so you know, none of the links in this page are sponsored(though I wouldn‚Äôt protest against itüòâ), they're just the best resources I could find on the web. 


### [Clickfunnels](https://www.clickfunnels.com/)

The big daddy of online sales funnels. Expensive as all hell, a little bit tacky looking from the outside but probably the single best all in one tool for creating sales funnels you can get. They basically have every tool you could ever need to build a sales funnel, built into one thing and they have fantastic learning resources included as well. 


### The Custom Route

If you don‚Äôt want to pay a minimum of $150 per month for a service, I don‚Äôt blame you. You can stitch together your own sales funnel with some of the tools below. 


#### Landing Page

You want your advertisement to direct users to a landing page. On this page you should have the free offer that they can have in exchange for their email address. An important thing to note is your call to action should be very clearly visible and that you don‚Äôt want users to be able to navigate to other pages on your site from here. It‚Äôs basically a take it or leave it situation. You can hire someone for a very little to build a landing page for you one something like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) or you can use something like [Leadpages](https://www.leadpages.com/) to build your own. 


#### Email Campaign

This step is very simple and I would recommend using a service like [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to run your conversion campaign. MailChimp has great templates that you can use for your campaign. 

You don‚Äôt actually need much more than a landing page and a solid email campaign to start out. Experiment and see what works for you. 


#### Brick and Mortar

Lastly, I want to discuss how you can apply a sales funnel to a brick and mortar business. The initial step is basically the same. You entice people to come to your business with a free offer like a complimentary massage of a free boxing routine. When they come to visit you, you can offer them some additional value and offer them another great deal. In the boxing example, you can give them a quick 10-minute personal session where you give them some tips and give them a week of training at a discount. After the week they will likely be much more committed to the idea and will be much more likely to sign up for full price classes.

I really hope you enjoyed reading this. If you have any suggestions, feel free to message me on any of my social media accounts and I will happily get back to you. Share this with friends if you think they might find it valuable. 

Goodbye, see you in the next post.üëã
